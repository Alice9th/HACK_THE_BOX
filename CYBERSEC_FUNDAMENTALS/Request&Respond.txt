Setting up Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a tool that acts as a proxy server and can be used to examine and modify HTTP requests. It provides a proxy that can route traffic from the browser through the proxy and view the various requests and responses between the client (web browser) and the webserver.

----------------------------//------------------------------------

HTTP Request

The image above (BURP) shows an HTTP GET request to the URL:

http://inlanefreight.com/users/login.html

The first line of an HTTP request contains three fields separated by spaces.

Field	Description
Method	The first field stands for the HTTP method or verb, which specifies the type of action to perform.
Path	The second field is the path to the resource being accessed. This field can also be suffixed with a query string.
Version	The third and final field is used to denote the HTTP version.

The next set of lines contain HTTP header value pairs. These are used to specify various attributes of a request. The headers are terminated with a new line, which is necessary for the server to validate the request. This can be followed by the request body, which we will analyze in later sections of this module.

HTTP Response:

Similar to the request, an HTTP response contains headers as well. The first line contains two fields separated by spaces. The first being the HTTP version, while the second denotes the HTTP response code. Response codes are used to determine if a request succeeded or not. The response body is present after the headers, separated by a new line. The response body is usually defined as HTML code. However, it can also respond with other code types such as JSON, website resources such as images, style sheets or scripts, or even a document such as a PDF document hosted on the webserver.
